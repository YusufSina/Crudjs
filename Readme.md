Hello everyone,

I am constantly trying to translate the works we repeat ourselves into a Javascript library.
Most of our projects still use jquery as a library.

For this reason, I have often translated the methods we use to object-oriented programming.

When using this library, I assume that jquery, jquery ui, jquery datatable, sweetalert2 libraries are installed. I'll try to explain version-by-version with further improvements.
